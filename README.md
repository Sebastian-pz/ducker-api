# Ducker API

This project is a social network inspired by Twitter, so in Ducker you can meet other people from all over the world and interact with them.

This API takes care of all the interactions with the database and the necessary modifications.

## How to run
The project is in "TypeScript" - "Express"

1. You need to download the repository

2. In the terminal, you need to run the following commands:

    * `npm install` to install all necessary packages

    * You need to copy our `.env` vars, so you can ask for these

    * `npm run dev` to run the local server and observe the changes

    * You can use other scripts like `npm run tsc` to compile TypeScript to JavaScript files in the build folder

3. Access to `http://localhost:3001` or your custom port.
